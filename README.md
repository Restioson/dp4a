# dp4a
Distributed Processing system for AVR in rust

DP4A is a hardware-dependent system for writing ergonomic distributed processing routines for the AVR microcontroller series. 
It leverages the power of macros to let you write concise, familiar, and readable code. WIP

# Diagram and explanation
The documentation breaks down the system. You can view it with `cargo docs --open`
